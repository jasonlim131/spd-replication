# Fine-Grained MLP Routing Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of fine-grained MLP routing comparing the original **4×4×4** configuration with the enhanced **4×8×4** configuration. The analysis focuses on two key metrics: **accuracy** and **pathway purity** to evaluate the effectiveness of the fine-grained routing approach.

## Key Findings

### 🎯 Accuracy Analysis

| Configuration | Standard MLP | Pathway MLP | Accuracy Drop |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Original (4×4×4) | 94.83% | 86.14% | 8.69% |
| Fine-Grained (4×8×4) | 94.56% | 86.09% | 8.47% |

**Key Insights:**
- The fine-grained routing maintains nearly identical accuracy to the original configuration
- Both configurations show similar accuracy drops when transitioning from standard to pathway MLPs
- The accuracy difference between configurations is negligible (-0.05%)

### 🛤️ Pathway Utilization

| Configuration | Total Pathways | Active Pathways | Utilization Rate |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Original (4×4×4) | 64 | 63 | 98.4% |
| Fine-Grained (4×8×4) | 128 | 123 | 96.1% |

**Key Insights:**
- Fine-grained routing doubles the number of available pathways (64 → 128)
- Utilization rate drops slightly (98.4% → 96.1%) but remains high
- 95% more active pathways provide increased specialization opportunities

### 🎨 Pathway Specialization & Purity

#### Average Purity Comparison
- **Original (4×4×4)**: 0.450 average purity
- **Fine-Grained (4×8×4)**: 0.562 average purity
- **Improvement**: +0.112 (+24.9% relative improvement)

#### High-Quality Pathway Distribution

| Purity Threshold | Original (4×4×4) | Fine-Grained (4×8×4) | Improvement |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| >40% purity | 36/63 (57.1%) | 95/123 (77.2%) | +20.1% |

## Detailed Analysis

### 🏆 Top Specialized Pathways

#### Original Configuration (4×4×4)
1. **Input1_Hidden1_Output0**: 97.4% purity → digit 1
2. **Input1_Hidden1_Output3**: 88.9% purity → digit 7
3. **Input3_Hidden0_Output3**: 84.3% purity → digit 0

#### Fine-Grained Configuration (4×8×4)
1. **Input3_Hidden6_Output3**: 100.0% purity → digit 3
2. **Input3_Hidden7_Output1**: 100.0% purity → digit 1
3. **Input3_Hidden5_Output0**: 97.6% purity → digit 1

**Key Observations:**
- Fine-grained routing achieves perfect specialization (100% purity) in multiple pathways
- More pathways achieve very high purity (>70%) in the fine-grained configuration
- Specialization is more distributed across different digit classes

### 🧠 Hidden Group Specialization

#### Original Configuration (4×4×4)
- **4 hidden groups**, each with 128 neurons
- Specialization patterns show moderate clustering by digit type
- Some groups handle multiple digit types with similar frequency

#### Fine-Grained Configuration (4×8×4)  
- **8 hidden groups**, each with 64 neurons
- Stronger specialization per group:
  - Hidden5: 32.3% specialization for digit 1
  - Hidden0: 19.9% specialization for digit 3
  - Hidden2: 24.6% specialization for digit 6
- More focused processing with clearer digit-specific patterns

### 🗺️ Input Region Analysis

Both configurations show similar input region specialization patterns:
- **Top-Left**: Specializes in digits 3, 8, 5 (original) vs 4, 2, 8 (fine-grained)
- **Top-Right**: Handles digits 7, 9, 8 (original) vs 6, 0, 8 (fine-grained)
- **Bottom-Left**: Processes digits 1, 6, 2 (original) vs 2, 3, 6 (fine-grained)  
- **Bottom-Right**: Focuses on digits 2, 1, 4 (original) vs 1, 9, 4 (fine-grained)

## Performance Trade-offs

### Advantages of Fine-Grained Routing (4×8×4)

✅ **Improved Pathway Purity**: 24.9% improvement in average purity
✅ **Better Specialization**: 77.2% of pathways achieve >40% purity vs 57.1%
✅ **More Specialized Pathways**: 22.0% achieve >70% purity vs 9.5%
