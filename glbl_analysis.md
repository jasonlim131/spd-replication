# GLBL Performance Analysis: Why 87.59% Instead of 96%?

## Current Results
- **Standard MLP**: 98.02% test accuracy
- **GLBL MLP**: 87.59% test accuracy  
- **Target**: 96%+ accuracy
- **Gap**: -10.43% underperformance

## Potential Issues

### 1. Training Configuration
- **Epochs**: 12 epochs may not be sufficient for GLBL convergence
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0005 might be too low for the complex pathway structure
- **GLBL Weight**: Linear schedule from 0.01→0.05 may be too aggressive

### 2. Architecture Mismatch
- **Pathway Structure**: 4×4×4 = 64 pathways might be over-partitioning
- **Hidden Units**: 512 units split into 4 groups = 128 per group (too small?)
- **Output Groups**: 10 classes → 4 groups = 2.5 classes per group (uneven)

### 3. Training Dynamics
- **GLBL Loss**: High values (1.0948) suggest pathways aren't specializing well
- **Active Pathways**: 2037.2 suggests over-activation (should be more selective)
- **Pathway Entropy**: 4.000 is close to maximum (log₂(4) ≈ 2), indicating poor specialization

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Better Architecture
```python
# Reduce pathway complexity
pathways = (2, 2, 2)  # 8 pathways instead of 64
hidden_groups = 2     # 256 units per group instead of 128
```

### 2. Improved Training
```python
config = {
    'epochs': 20,              # More training time
    'learning_rate': 0.001,    # Higher learning rate
    'glbl_weight_start': 0.001, # Gentler GLBL regularization
    'glbl_weight_end': 0.01,
    'top_k': 4,               # More selective pathway activation
}
```

### 3. Training Schedule
- **Warm-up**: Train classification first, then add GLBL loss
- **Curriculum**: Start with simpler pathway structure, gradually increase complexity
- **Adaptive**: Adjust GLBL weight based on pathway specialization metrics

## Next Steps
1. Test simpler 2×2×2 pathway structure
2. Implement warm-up training schedule
3. Add pathway specialization monitoring during training
4. Compare with successful 96% configuration from previous results
