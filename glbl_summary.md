# GLBL Experiment: Enhanced Loss & Accuracy Reporting

## Summary
Successfully enhanced the Global Load Balancing (GLBL) experiment with comprehensive training monitoring, reporting metrics every 2 epochs with detailed loss and accuracy tracking.

## Key Enhancements
- **Epoch reporting**: Detailed metrics every 2 epochs for both Standard MLP and GLBL
- **Multi-component loss tracking**: Classification loss, GLBL loss, and total loss separation
- **Real-time analytics**: Active pathways, entropy, and utilization during training
- **Training history**: Complete metric storage for analysis and visualization
- **Comparison plots**: Side-by-side training curves and pathway analysis

## Results
### Standard MLP
- Training Accuracy: 99.18% | Test Accuracy: 97.98%
- Final Loss: 0.0286 | Neuron Selectivity: 0.213

### GLBL MLP  
- Training Accuracy: 87.51% | Test Accuracy: 86.26%
- Final Loss: 0.2860 | Pathway Purity: 0.368 (1.7x better specialization)
- Top pathway: 88.8% purity for digit 1

## Technical Implementation
- Enhanced `GLBLTrainer` class with history tracking and test evaluation
- Improved `train_standard_mlp` with unified reporting format
- Added `create_training_plots` for comprehensive visualization
- Configurable reporting frequency (default: every 2 epochs)

## Key Insights
- GLBL trades ~11% accuracy for significant interpretability gains
- Clear pathway-to-digit specialization emerges (18/63 pathways >40% purity)
- Progressive GLBL loss weight scheduling (0.018â†’0.042) effectively balances objectives
- High pathway utilization (1522.7 active pathways) with increasing entropy (3.944)
