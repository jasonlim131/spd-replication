# LLM Routing Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've created `llm-routing.py` which adapts the MLP pathway routing concept for Language Models with the following key components:

### 1. Layer-wise Routing Architecture
- **Every Other Layer**: Implements routing on alternating transformer layers (layers 0, 2, 4, 6 in an 8-layer model)
- **Pathway Decomposition**: Each MLP is split into 16 pathways, with only top-4 active at any time
- **Smart Selection**: A learned router network decides which pathways to activate based on input

### 2. Key Classes
- `RoutingConfig`: Configuration dataclass for routing parameters
- `PathwayRouter`: Neural network that scores pathways 
- `RoutedTransformerLayer`: Modified transformer layer with pathway routing in the MLP
- `RoutedLLM`: Wrapper that manages all routed layers

### 3. Global Load Balancing (GLBL)
- Prevents pathway collapse by encouraging balanced usage
- Loss term: `GLBL = N_pathways × Σ(frequency_i × score_i)`
- Maintains global statistics with momentum updates

### 4. Monosemanticity Measurement

The implementation measures how "monosemantic" (specialized) each pathway becomes:

```python
# Core metric calculation
token_probs = token_counts / total_tokens
pathway_entropy = entropy(token_probs)
purity = 1 - (pathway_entropy / max_entropy)
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Purity**: How concentrated a pathway is on specific tokens (0-1, higher is better)
- **Token Specialization**: Which tokens most frequently activate each pathway
- **Pathway Utilization**: Percentage of pathways actively used

### 5. Visualization
Creates a 4-panel plot showing:
- Pathway purity across layers
- Distribution of purity scores
- Top specialized pathways with their preferred tokens
- Utilization rates by layer

## How It Differs from Original MLP Routing

1. **Sequence Processing**: Handles token sequences instead of single images
2. **Layer Integration**: Routes within existing transformer layers rather than creating new architecture
3. **Token-based Analysis**: Measures specialization on tokens rather than image classes
4. **Partial Routing**: Only routes MLPs, leaves attention unchanged

## Key Insights

1. **Monosemanticity Through Routing**: By forcing the model to select specific pathways, we encourage specialization
2. **Interpretability**: Specialized pathways are easier to understand - e.g., a pathway that activates primarily for punctuation
3. **Efficiency**: Only computing active pathways could reduce computation by ~75% (4/16 pathways active)

## Usage Example

```python
# Create routed model
routing_config = RoutingConfig(
    num_pathways=16,
    top_k_pathways=4,
    route_every_n_layers=2
)
routed_model = RoutedLLM(base_model, routing_config)

# Train with GLBL
train_routed_llm(routed_model, train_texts, tokenizer)

# Measure monosemanticity
metrics = measure_monosemanticity(routed_model, tokenizer, test_texts)
print(f"Average Purity: {metrics['avg_purity']:.4f}")
```

## Future Directions

1. **Scale to Larger Models**: Test on Pythia-70M, 160M, or 410M
2. **Attention Routing**: Extend routing to attention layers
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Group pathways by semantic function rather than just token frequency
4. **Dynamic Routing**: Adjust number of active pathways based on complexity
